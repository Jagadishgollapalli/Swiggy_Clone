### Package.JSON vs Package-lock.JSON

``` 
It keeps a track of what version of that package is installed in your system. Package-lock.JSON keep a track of exact version that is being installed. What is this integrity? So why is this integrity? This integrity is basically a hash, a SHA 5.2 hash,Why is this hash present? Over there? This hash is present basically, to avoid that, package-lock. JSON keeps a hash to verify that whatever is there in my machine right, whatever is there right now in my device machine is the same version which is being deployed onto the production.
